# Newton
Explore fractals generated by Newton's method

To learn how Newton's method is used to generate fractals, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_fractal). The iterative formula used here is:

Currently, p is restricted to be a polynomial function.

### Instructions for use: 
Run the file newton.py to open a display window along with a GUI which allows changing various parameters, recoloring, translating, and zooming in or out. The file cuda_fractal.py contains a parallized implementation of Newton's method which runs on the GPU for fast rendering.

### Navigating the display window: 
Click anywhere on the display window to move the center of the display to the point clicked on.

### Using the GUI: 
Enter values into the boxes to change the color, number of iterations, polynomial, and zoom factor. Click the buttons to apply changes or perform an action.

### Buttons: 
* Update: updates the display window with the values in the left column. You should click this whenever you change any of these values. 
* Zoom in/Zoom out: zooms in or out by the factor specified. 
* Save: saves the current display with an automatically generated name containing information about the current settings. 
* Recenter: resets the center of the fractal to the origin. 
* Recenter + Unzoom: resets the center of the fractal to the origin and undoes any zoom ins/outs that have been performed.

### Values: 
* Red: integer between 0 and 255.
* Green: integer between 0 and 255.
* Blue: integer between 0 and 255.
* Iterations: integer greater than 0, representing the maximum number of iterations of Newton's method to perform at each point. Lower values result in brighter images with less contrast. 
* A: complex number of the form x.x+x.xj, representing the value of a from the above formula. Using complex values results in a "twisting" of the fractal (compare A = 1 vs A = .5+.5j, for example). 
* Polynomial: list of complex numbers separted by commas, representing the coefficients of the polynomial function to perform Newton's method on. Ex: -1, 0, 7, 2, 0, 1 would represent -1 + 7z^2 + 2z^3 + z^5
* Zoom factor: float greater than 0.

Here are some examples of images created by the program:
